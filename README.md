Technical Stack
Technology	Version	Purpose
Python	3.8+	Core programming language
Selenium	4.15.2	Browser automation
Flask	3.0.0	Email service API
WebDriver Manager	4.0.1	Automatic ChromeDriver management
Chrome/Chromium	Latest	Web browser for automation
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Google Chrome browser installed
Gmail account with App Password enabled (for email sending)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medius-assignment.git
cd medius-assignment
Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Verify Installation
python form_automation.py --help
Configuration
1. Form Automation Configuration
Edit form_automation.py and update the form_data dictionary with your information:
form_data = {
    "name": "Your Full Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "message": "Your message here",
}
2. Email Service Configuration
Edit email_service.py and configure your email credentials:
YOUR_EMAIL = "your.email@gmail.com"
YOUR_APP_PASSWORD = "your_16_char_app_password"
YOUR_NAME = "Your Full Name"
GITHUB_REPO = "https://github.com/yourusername/medius-assignment"
3. Getting Gmail App Password
Go to Google Account Settings
Navigate to Security → 2-Step Verification (enable if not already)
Scroll to App passwords
Generate new app password for "Mail"
Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
Usage
Method 1: Run Complete Automation
python form_automation.py
python email_service.py
Method 2: Use Flask API
python email_service.py

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/send-assignment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender_email": "your.email@gmail.com",
    "sender_password": "your_app_password",
    "candidate_name": "Your Name",
    "screenshot_path": "screenshots/confirmation_20240101_120000.png",
    "github_repo": "https://github.com/yourusername/medius-assignment",
    "resume_path": "documents/resume.pdf",
    "portfolio_links": ["https://github.com/yourusername/project1"]
  }'
Method 3: Integrated Script
from form_automation import GoogleFormAutomation
from email_service import send_assignment_direct

automation = GoogleFormAutomation(FORM_URL)
automation.setup_driver()
automation.fill_form(form_data)
screenshot_path = automation.submit_form()
automation.close()

send_assignment_direct(
    YOUR_EMAIL,
    YOUR_APP_PASSWORD,
    YOUR_NAME,
    screenshot_path,
    GITHUB_REPO
)

Technical Approach
Architecture Overview
User Configuration → Form Automation Layer → Email Automation Layer → Assignment Submitted
Each module (form automation and email sending) is independent, modular, and reusable.
Key Design Choices:
Modular Architecture: Separation of concerns for better maintainability
Error Handling: Fallbacks, exception logs, and screenshots on failure
Dynamic Detection: Automatically adapts to different Google Form layouts
Security: App passwords and .env for sensitive credentials
Screenshots
Form Automation Example
✓ WebDriver initialized successfully
✓ Form loaded successfully
✓ Fields filled and submitted
✓ Screenshot saved: screenshots/confirmation_20241025_143022.png
Email Sent Example
✓ Attached screenshot: confirmation_20241025_143022.png
✓ Email sent successfully!
Troubleshooting
Issue	Error	Solution
ChromeDriver Version Mismatch	SessionNotCreatedException	Update Chrome or WebDriver Manager
Email Authentication Failed	SMTPAuthenticationError	Use App Password, enable 2FA
Form Fields Not Detected	NoSuchElementException	Increase WebDriver wait time
Screenshot Not Captured	FileNotFoundError	Create screenshots directory
Headless Mode Fails	Element not visible	Increase window size or disable headless mode
Testing
Run Unit Tests
pip install pytest pytest-cov
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
Manual Testing Checklist
Form loads and fills successfully
Confirmation screenshot captured
Email sent with attachments
Security Considerations
Never commit sensitive credentials
Use .env files and app passwords
Respect Gmail rate limits (500 emails/day)
Performance Metrics
Metric	Time (approx)
Form Load	3–5 sec
Form Fill	2–3 sec
Submission	3–5 sec
Screenshot Capture	<1 sec
Email Send	2–3 sec
Total	~15–20 sec
Future Enhancements
File upload support in forms
Parallel form submissions
Dashboard for submission tracking
Retry mechanism for failed submissions
Docker container for deployment
Code Quality
Follows PEP 8
Type hints and docstrings
Low cyclomatic complexity
High maintainability index (>80)
